# **Google News Scraper**

Library that helps make it easier to scrape many links from Google News and extract all the text/content. Created using Selenium and Newspaper3k libraries.

This library was created because I wanted to share the code I had created with other people, as well as helping me learn more about the structure of the library and how to create it.

This library is the first library I created, so there are still some problems that are new to me, and still need to be resolved
